  abstract = {``Sign in or create an account to continue.'' At a time in which every website seems to require its own user account, these words often elicit a groan---and the inevitability of yet another password that will soon be forgotten. But for people like Maria Munir, the British college student who famously came out as nonbinary to then president Barack Obama on live TV, the prospect of creating a new user account is more than mere annoyance.1 Websites that require information about gender as part of their account registration process almost always only provide a binary choice: ``male or female.''2 For Munir, those options are insufficient. They also take an emotional toll: ``I wince as I'm forced to choose `female' over `male' every single time, because that's what my passport says, and {\dots} being non-binary is still not legally recognised in the UK,'' Munir explains.3},
